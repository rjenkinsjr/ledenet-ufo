# `ledenet-ufo`
This NodeJS module provides an API for controlling [WiFi RGBW controllers made by LEDENET](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MDKOSN0/).

Credit goes to [sidoh](https://github.com/sidoh) for developing a [Ruby implementation](https://github.com/sidoh/ledenet_api) providing me with the inspiration (and a reference to compare against!) to write this module.
